Neata and congrats for taking part in our internship program! Now let’s have some fun!

Our goal throughout the internship will be to learn to properly develop software. We are targeting web development and the focus is on PHP and Symfony but please note that we are also building a mindset and we are using principles and guidelines that are widely used in any development context and language.

In order to achieve this goal, we’ll simulate that we work on a real project and we need to create the back-end for a gym application. The idea behind the app is that it needs to allow users to create an account and be able to see and interact with the upcoming sports programs that the gym provides.

The client (the gym representatives) will be the trainers and they will be responsible for stating the requests and the features that the app needs and you will be the developers. Behind each feature is a lesson and something new to learn (regarding PHP, Symfony, databases, architecture, testing, external communication, performance, or any other development-related guideline). Therefore, we advise you to focus on what you learn throughout the process and not on the actual gym application and its features. While it is true that we’ll make everything as close to a real project as possible, in the end, it is still a playground and some features that you might expect from a fully working application might be missing.

The main functionalities that the application will have (business-related) are the following:
Management of sports programs
Import programs from a warehouse and make them available in the app
Display programs to the users (filter, paginate, sort, etc.)
Cancel programs (as an administrator)
Analytics
Management of users (regular and administrators)
Authentication
Registration
Restrict
Forgot password

We will expand on each functionality mentioned above (and more) throughout the internship. The information here is just a glimpse of what we will be focusing on.

Let’s go!
